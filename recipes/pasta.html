    <h2>Pasta Bake</h2>
    <p>This pasta bake recipe is my family's favorite dish. Hopefully, you already have most of these basic ingredients at home, so you can make it tonight!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces mostaccioli, or similar size, pasta</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) can mushrooms, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
      <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in mostaccioli and return to a boil. Cook mostaccioli uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cook ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until browned.</li>
      <li>Combine spaghetti sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, mostaccioli, and ground beef mixture in a large bowl; transfer to the prepared casserole dish.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until very hot, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
